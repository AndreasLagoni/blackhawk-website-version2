                      <p>A: The rules on the server is the following:
                          <br>Admins
                          <span style="color: #CF422C"><br>- Admins will never be playing on the server, only monitor and moderate.
                            <br>- Admins will never give you items.
                            <br>- Admins will never kill animal's, npc's or player's.
                            <br>- Admins will never loot boxes etc.
                            <br>- Admins will never change the time of day.
                            <br>- Admins will never spawn events or reset them.</span>
                            <br>If you see any admin not upholding these rules, please contact any of the owners.
                            <br>Generel rules/guidelines: 
                            <br><span style="color: #CF422C">- We don't welcome toxic people or people misusing the chat to say racial slurs or any toxic behavior.
                            <br>- Advertisement is not allowed and is a banable offence. 
                            <br>- Griefing is not allowed. </span>
                            <br>People will be able to report people as well as see the ingame chat on discord under "ingame-chat". 
                            <br>This will help admins and other users to help the community on our server to be as toxic free as possible!

                    <button class="collapsible">Q: What do we do here?</button>
                    <div class="content">
                      <p>A: We want to create the perfect Rust world, where one wipe is connected to all the other wipes in a way that you can recap overall stats and scores.
                         Our goal is to be the most prestigious Rust server out there. Featuring new content often and listening to the community. We wish to show alot of features
                         but at the same time keep the Rust experience impactful and not change too much.  
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="collapsible">Q: What is the score based on?</button>
                    <div class="content">
                      <p>A: In the beginning the score will be based on the number of kills aquired by the players. This will most likely change in the future since being very good at pvp is not the only factor
                          of skill displayed in Rust. Therefore any suggestions on how the score should be handled would be much appreciated. We have alot of ideas and hopefully you will enjoy them!
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="collapsible">Q: Will I meet admins in the server?</button>
                    <div class="content">
                      <p>Admins will most likely be online alot of the times, but you will never see them visible unless it's neccessary. We are very strong and strict when it comes to giving the players on our server
                          the best experience and as admins we would never destroy that experience with any abuse or trolling. 
                          <br>Buttom line is: ADMIN DO NOT PLAY ACTIVELY ON THE SERVER!

                    <div class="content">
                      <p>A: We will start off the server with no restrictions as to the # of players on a team. We wish to see how this pans out. This may change in the future.
